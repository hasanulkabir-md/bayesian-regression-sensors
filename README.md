# Bayesian Regression for Noisy Sensor Data

This project applies **Bayesian Linear Regression** to simulate and calibrate noisy sensor data using Python and PyMC.  
It demonstrates how Bayesian inference can estimate uncertainty in real-world measurements — a valuable concept in robotics, IoT, and autonomous systems.
